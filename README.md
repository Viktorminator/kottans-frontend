## Linux CLI, and HTTP

I've not expected that this CLI course will be useful to me, because I've been dealing with cli & terminal for a very long time from now. I have learned new things! Level up!

## Git Collaboration

Nice course, will recommend this to other developers.

## Intro to HTML and CSS

Nothing really new to me.
